A low-level video emulation plugin, based on the pixel-perfect angrylion RDP plugin with added multithreading. Made for Project 64 versions 2.x and above but still should work with older versions.

!!!info
Make sure to enable **Multithreaded Rendering** and increase threads until slowdown is minimised
!!!

!!!warning
The renderer is heavily CPU reliant, and so if you dont have sufficient CPU power check out the softrender fork of [GLideN64](GLideN64.md)
!!!
