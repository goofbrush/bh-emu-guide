This is a fork of GLideN64[[rev.7a11c6ca](https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64/commit/7a11c6ca6b3042ecf2a55c0290de947690a08a04)] that fixes render triangles when polygon culling is disabled (restores collision to buildings and slopes).

!!!info
Make sure to **enable** framebuffer emulation
!!!

!!!danger This plugin is NOT recommended for speedrun usage

Requires specifically **Project 64 version 1.6** for the culling fix to work, other versions will let you clip through buildings and slopes which will invalidate your run.
