!!!info 
2.3 is generally recommended as the most accurate plugin is designed for v2.3

### v1.6 [!file Project64 1.6](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmqktdkt45hgu8u/Project%2064%201.6.rar?dl=1)

1.6 has access to a fork of glide that patches collision, its less accurate but runs better. Not reccomened for speedrunning, but fine for casual use
